      <h2>Q and A</h2>
      <h4>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able to Answer</h4>
      <ol class="qna__ordered">
        <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
        <ul class="qna__unordered">
          <li>


            We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it
            quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every
            trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
            evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger
            evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity.
            Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this
            is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
          
          
          </li>
          <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
        <ul class="qna__unordered">
          <li>


            Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you
            start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if
            you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who
            emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon
            game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most
            effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no
            button mashing at all is required.

                    Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different: in brief, 
                    things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.

                  The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
                  created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket monstr Red and
                  Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
                  after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
                  Green version was not released outside Japan

          2000 and European release date of April 2001. Like the previous
